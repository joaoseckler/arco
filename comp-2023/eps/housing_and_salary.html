<h3 id="part-a-house-hunting">Part A: House Hunting</h3>
<p>You have graduated from MIT and now have a great job! You move to the
San Francisco Bay Area and decide that you want to start saving to buy a
house. As housing prices are very high in the Bay Area, you realize you
are going to have to save for several years before you can afford to
make the down payment on a house. In Part A, we are going to determine
how long it will take you to save enough money to make the down payment
given the following assumptions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Call the cost of your dream home <code>total_cost</code>.</li>
<li>Call the portion of the cost needed for a down payment
<code>portion_down_payment</code>. For simplicity, assume that
portion_down_payment = 0.25 (25%).</li>
<li>Call the amount that you have saved thus far
<code>current_savings</code>. You start with a current savings of
$0.</li>
<li>Assume that you invest your current savings wisely, with an annual
return of <code>r</code>(in other words, at the end of each month, you
receive an additional <code>current_savings\*r/12</code> funds to put
into your savings – the 12 is because <code>r</code> is an annual rate).
Assume that your investments earn a return of r = 0.04 (4%).</li>
<li>Assume your annual salary is <code>annual_salary</code>.</li>
<li>Assume you are going to dedicate a certain amount of your salary
each month to saving for the down payment. Call that
<code>portion_saved</code>. This variable should be in decimal form
(i.e. 0.1 for 10%).</li>
<li>At the end of each month, your savings will be increased by the
return on your investment, plus a percentage of your
<code>monthly salary</code>(annual salary / 12).</li>
</ol>
<p>Write a program to calculate how many months it will take you to save
up enough money for a down payment. You will want your main variables to
be floats, so you should cast user inputs to floats.</p>
<p>Your program should ask the user to enter the following variables: 1.
The starting annual salary (annual_salary) 2. The portion of salary to
be saved (portion_saved) 3. The cost of your dream home (total_cost)</p>
<h4 id="hints">Hints</h4>
<p>To help you get started, here is a rough outline of the stages you
should probably follow in writing your code:</p>
<ul>
<li>Retrieve user input. Look at input() if you need help with getting
user input. For this problem set, you can assume that users will enter
valid input (e.g. they won’t enter a string when you expect an int)</li>
<li>Initialize some state variables. You should decide what information
you need. Be careful about values that represent annual amounts and
those that represent monthly amounts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Try different inputs and see how long it takes to save for a down
payment. <strong>Please make your program print results in the format
shown in the test cases below.</strong></p>
<h4 id="test-case-1">Test Case 1</h4>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;
Enter your annual salary: 120000
Enter the percent of your salary to save, as a decimal: .10
Enter the cost of your dream home: 1000000
Number of months: 183
&gt;&gt;&gt;</code></pre>
<h4 id="test-case-2">Test Case 2</h4>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;
Enter your annual salary: 80000
Enter the percent of your salary to save, as a decimal: .15
Enter the cost of your dream home: 500000
Number of months: 105
&gt;&gt;&gt;</code></pre>
<h3 id="part-b-saving-with-a-raise">Part B: Saving, with a raise</h3>
<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p>In Part A, we unrealistically assumed that your salary didn’t change.
But you are an MIT graduate, and clearly you are going to be worth more
to your company over time! So we are going to build on your solution to
Part A by factoring in a raise every six months.</p>
<p>In <code>ps1b.py</code>, copy your solution to Part A (as we are
going to reuse much of that machinery). Modify your program to include
the following</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Have the user input a semi-annual salary raise
<code>semi_annual_raise</code> (as a decimal percentage)</li>
<li>After the 6<sup>th</sup> month, increase your salary by that
percentage. Do the same after the 12th month, the 18<sup>th</sup>, and
so on.</li>
</ol>
<p>Write a program to calculate how many months it will take you save up
enough money for a down payment. LIke before, assume that your
investments earn a return of <code>r</code> = 0.04 (or 4%) and the
required down payment percentage is 0.25 (or 25%). Have the user enter
the following variables:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The starting annual salary (annual_salary)</li>
<li>The percentage of salary to be saved (portion_saved)</li>
<li>The cost of your dream home (total_cost)</li>
<li>The semi­annual salary raise (semi_annual_raise)</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="hints-1">Hints</h4>
<p>To help you get started, here is a rough outline of the stages you
should probably follow in writing your code: * Retrieve user input. *
Initialize some state variables. You should decide what information you
need. Be sure to be careful about values that represent annual amounts
and those that represent monthly amounts. * Be careful about when you
increase your salary – this should only happen <strong>after</strong>
the 6<sup>th</sup>, 12<sup>th</sup> , 18<sup>th</sup> month, and so on.
Try different inputs and see how quickly or slowly you can save enough
for a down payment. P lease make your program print results in the
format shown in the test cases below. #### Test Case 1</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;
Enter your starting annual salary: 120000
Enter the percent of your salary to save, as a decimal: .05
Enter the cost of your dream home: 500000
Enter the semi­annual raise, as a decimal: .03
Number of months: 142
&gt;&gt;&gt;</code></pre>
<h4 id="test-case-2-1">Test Case 2</h4>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;
Enter your starting annual salary: 80000
Enter the percent of your salary to save, as a decimal: .1
Enter the cost of your dream home: 800000
Enter the semi­annual raise, as a decimal: .03
Number of months: 159
&gt;&gt;&gt;</code></pre>
<h4 id="test-case-3">Test Case 3</h4>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;
Enter your starting annual salary: 75000
Enter the percent of your salary to save, as a decimal: .05
Enter the cost of your dream home: 1500000
Enter the semi­annual raise, as a decimal: .05
Number of months: 261
&gt;&gt;&gt;</code></pre>
<h3 id="part-c-finding-the-right-amount-to-save-away">Part C: Finding
the right amount to save away</h3>
<p>In Part B, you had a chance to explore how both the percentage of
your salary that you save each month and your annual raise affect how
long it takes you to save for a down payment. This is nice, but suppose
you want to set a particular goal, e.g. to be able to afford the down
payment in three years. How much should you save each month to achieve
this? In this problem, you are going to write a program to answer that
question. To simplify things, assume:</p>
<p>Your semi­annual raise is .07 (7%) Your investments have an annual
return of 0.04 (4%) The down payment is 0.25 (25%) of the cost of the
house The cost of the house that you are saving for is $1M.</p>
<p>You are now going to try to find the best rate of savings to achieve
a down payment on a $1M house in 36 months. Since hitting this exactly
is a challenge, we simply want your savings to be within $100 of the
required down payment.</p>
<p>In<code>ps1c.py</code>, write a program to calculate the best savings
rate, as a function of your starting salary. You should use
<strong>bisection search</strong> to help you do this efficiently. You
should keep track of the number of steps it takes your bisections search
to finish. You should be able to reuse some of the code you wrote for
part B in this problem.</p>
<p>Because we are searching for a value that is in principle a float, we
are going to limit ourselves to two decimals of accuracy (i.e., we may
want to save at 7.04% ­­ or 0.0704 in decimal – but we are not going to
worry about the difference between 7.041% and 7.039%). This means we can
search for an integer between 0 and 10000 (using integer division), and
then convert it to a decimal percentage (using float division) to use
when we are calculating the <code>current_savings</code> after 36
months. By using this range, there are only a finite number of numbers
that we are searching over, as opposed to the infinite number of
decimals between 0 and 1. This range will help prevent infinite loops.
The reason we use 0 to 10000 is to account for two additional decimal
places in the range 0% to 100%. Your code should print out a decimal
(e.g. 0.0704 for 7.04%).</p>
<p>Try different inputs for your starting salary, and see how the
percentage you need to save changes to reach your desired down payment.
Also keep in mind it may not be possible for to save a down payment in a
year and a half for some salaries. In this case your function should
notify the user that it is not possible to save for the down payment in
36 months with a print statement. P lease make your program print
results in the format shown in the test cases below.</p>
<p>Note: There are multiple right ways to implement bisection
search/number of steps so your results may not perfectly match those of
the test case.</p>
<h4 id="hints-2">Hints</h4>
<ul>
<li>There may be multiple savings rates that yield a savings amount that
is within $100 of the required down payment on a $1M house. In this
case, you can just return any of the possible values.</li>
<li>Depending on your stopping condition and how you compute a trial
value for bisection search, your number of steps may vary slightly from
the example test cases.</li>
<li>Watch out for integer division when calculating if a percentage
saved is appropriate and when calculating final decimal percentage
savings rate.</li>
<li>Remember to reset the appropriate variable(s) to their initial
values for each iteration of bisection search.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="test-case-1-1">Test Case 1</h4>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;
Enter the starting salary: 150000
Best savings rate: 0.4411
Steps in bisection search: 12
