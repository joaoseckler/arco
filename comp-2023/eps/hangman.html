course</a> 6-0001 - Introduction to Computer Science and programming in
python, as offered in 2016</em></p>
<p>You will implement a variation of the classic word game Hangman. If
you are unfamiliar with the rules of the game, read <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)</a>.
Don’t be intimidated by this problem ­ it’s actually easier than it
looks! We will ‘scaffold’ this problem, guiding you through the creation
of helper functions before you implement the actual game.</p>
<h3 id="a-getting-started">A) Getting Started</h3>
<p>Download the files “hangman.py” and “words.txt”, at the end of this
page, and <strong>save them both in the same directory</strong>. Run the
file hangman.py before writing any code to ensure your files are saved
correctly. The code we have given you loads in words from a file. You
should see the following output in your shell:</p>
<pre><code>Loading word list from file...
55900 words loaded.</code></pre>
<p>If you see the above text, continue on to Hangman Game Requirements.
If you don’t, double check that both files are saved in the same
place!</p>
<h3 id="b-hangman-game-requirements">B) Hangman Game Requirements</h3>
<p>You will implement a function called <code>hangman</code> that will
allow the user to play hangman against the computer. The computer picks
the word, and the player tries to guess letters in the word.</p>
<p>Here is the general behavior we want to implement. Don’t be
intimidated! This is just a description; we will break this down into
steps and provide further functional specs later on in the pset so keep
reading!</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The computer must select a word at random from the list of available
words that was provided in words.txt Note that words.txt contains words
in all lowercase letters.</li>
<li>The user is given a certain number of guesses at the beginning.</li>
<li>The game is interactive; the user inputs their guess and the
computer either:</li>
</ol>
<ol type="a">
<li>reveals the letter if it exists in the secret word</li>
<li>penalize the user and updates the number of guesses remaining</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>The game ends when either the user guesses the secret word, or the
user runs out of guesses.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="hangman-part-1-three-helper-functions">Hangman Part 1: Three
helper functions</h2>
<p>Before we have you write code to organize the hangman game, we are
going to break down the problem into logical subtasks, creating three
helper functions you will need to have in order for this game to work.
This is a common approach to computational problem solving, and one we
want you to begin experiencing.</p>
<p>The file hangman.py has a number of already implemented functions you
can use while writing up your solution. You can ignore the code in the
two functions at the top of the file that have already been implemented
for you, though you should understand how to use each helper function by
reading the docstrings.</p>
<h3 id="a-determine-whether-the-word-has-been-guessed">1.A) Determine
whether the word has been guessed</h3>
<p>First, implement the function <code>is_word_guessed</code> that takes
in two parameters ­ a string, <code>secret_word</code>, and a list of
letters (strings), <code>letters_guessed</code>. This function returns a
boolean <code>True</code> if <code>secret_word</code> has been guessed
(i.e., all the letters of <code>secret_word</code> are in
<code>letters_guessed</code>), and <code>False</code> otherwise. This
function will be useful in helping you decide when the hangman game has
been successfully completed, and becomes an end­test for any iterative
loop that checks letters against the secret word.</p>
<p>For this function, you may assume that all the letters in
<code>secret_word</code> and <code>letters_guessed</code> are
lowercase.</p>
<p>Example Usage:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; secret_word = &#39;apple&#39;
&gt;&gt;&gt; letters_guessed = [&#39;e&#39;, &#39;i&#39;, &#39;k&#39;, &#39;p&#39;, &#39;r&#39;, &#39;s&#39;]
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(is_word_guessed(secret_word, letters_guessed))
False</code></pre>
<h3 id="b-getting-the-users-guess">1.B) Getting the user’s guess</h3>
<p>Next, implement the function <code>get_guessed_word</code> that takes
in two parameters ­ a string, <code>secret_word</code>, and a list of
letters, <code>letters_guessed</code>. This function returns a string
that is comprised of letters and underscores, based on what letters in
<code>letters_guessed</code> are in <code>secret_word</code>. This
shouldn’t be too different from <code>is_word_guessed</code>!</p>
<p>We are going to use an underscore followed by a space (_ ) to
represent unknown letters. We could have chosen other symbols, but the
combination of underscore and space is visible and easily discerned.
Note that the space is super important, as otherwise it hard to
distinguish whether ____ is four elements long or three. This is called
usability –­ it’s very important, when programming, to consider the
usability of your program. If users find your program difficult to
understand or operate, they won’t use it! We encourage you to think
about usability when designing your program.</p>
<p><strong>Hint:</strong> In designing your function, think about what
information you want to return when done, whether you need a place to
store that information as you loop over a data structure, and how you
want to add information to your accumulated result.</p>
<h4 id="example-usage">Example Usage:</h4>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; secret_word = &#39;apple&#39;
&gt;&gt;&gt; letters_guessed = [&#39;e&#39;, &#39;i&#39;, &#39;k&#39;, &#39;p&#39;, &#39;r&#39;, &#39;s&#39;]
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(get_guessed_word(secret_word, letters_guessed))
&#39;_ pp_ e&#39;</code></pre>
<h3 id="c-getting-all-available-letters">1.C) Getting all available
letters</h3>
<p>Next, implement the function <code>get_available_letters</code> that
takes in one parameter ­ a list of letters,
<code>letters_guessed</code>. This function returns a string that is
comprised of lowercase English letters –­ all lowercase English letters
that are not in <code>letters_guessed</code>.</p>
<p>This function should return the letters in alphabetical order. For
this function, you may assume that all the letters in letters_guessed
are lowercase.</p>
<p><strong>Hint:</strong> You might consider using
<code>string.ascii_lowercase</code>, which is a string comprised of all
lowercase letters:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import string
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(string.ascii_lowercase)
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz</code></pre>
<p>Example Usage:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; letters_guessed = [&#39;e&#39;, &#39;i&#39;, &#39;k&#39;, &#39;p&#39;, &#39;r&#39;, &#39;s&#39;]
&gt;&gt;&gt; print get_available_letters(letters_guessed)
abcdfghjlmnoqtuvwxyz</code></pre>
<h2 id="hangman-part-2-the-game">Hangman Part 2: The Game</h2>
<p>Now that you have built some useful functions, you can turn to
implementing the function <code>hangman</code>, which takes one
parameter:­ the <code>secret_word</code> the user is to guess.</p>
<p>Initially, you can (and should!) manually set this secret word when
you run this function – this will make it easier to test your code. But
in the end, you will want the computer to select this secret word at
random before inviting you or some other user to play the game by
running this function.</p>
<p>Calling the <code>hangman</code>function starts up an interactive
game of Hangman between the user and the computer. In designing your
code, be sure you take advantage of the three helper functions,
<code>is_word_guessed</code>, <code>get_guessed_word</code>, and
<code>get_available_letters</code>, that you’ve defined in the previous
part!</p>
<p>Below are the game requirements broken down in different categories.
Make sure your implementation fits all the requirements!</p>
<h3 id="game-requirements">Game Requirements</h3>
<h4 id="a.-game-architecture">A. Game Architecture:</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li>The computer must select a word at random from the list of available
words that was provided in words.txt. The functions for loading the word
list and selecting a random word have already been provided for you in
hangman.py.</li>
<li>Users start with 6 guesses.</li>
<li>At the start of the game, let the user know how many letters the
computer’s word contains and how many guesses s/he starts with.</li>
<li>The computer keeps track of all the letters the user has not guessed
so far and before each turn shows the user the “remaining letters”</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Example Game Implementation:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Loading word list from file...
55900 words loaded.
Welcome to the game Hangman!
I am thinking of a word that is 4 letters long.
-------------
You have 6 guesses left.
Available letters: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz</code></pre>
<h4 id="b.-user-computer-interaction">B. User-­Computer
Interaction:</h4>
<p>The game must be interactive and flow as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Before each guess, you should display to the user:</li>
</ol>
<ol type="a">
<li>Remind the user of how many guesses s/he has left after each
guess.</li>
<li>all the letters the user has not yet guessed</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Ask the user to supply one guess at a time. (Look at the user input
requirements below to see what types of inputs you can expect from the
user)</li>
<li>Immediately after each guess, the user should be told whether the
letter is in the computer’s word.</li>
<li>After each guess, you should also display to the user the computer’s
word, with guessed letters displayed and unguessed letters replaced with
an underscore and space (_ )</li>
<li>At the end of the guess, print some dashes (­­­­­) to help separate
individual guesses from each other</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Example Game Implementation:</strong></p>
<p>(The <strong>blue</strong> color below is only there to show you what
the user typed in, as opposed to what the computer output.)</p>
<pre><code>You have 6 guesses left.
Available letters: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
Please guess a letter: a
Good guess: _ a_ _
------------
You have 6 guesses left.
Available letters: bcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
Please guess a letter: b
Oops! That letter is not in my word: _ a_ _</code></pre>
<h4 id="c.-user-input-requirements">C. User Input Requirements:</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li>You may assume that the user will only guess one character at a
time, but the user can choose any number, symbol or letter. Your code
should accept capital and lowercase letters as valid guesses!</li>
<li>If the user inputs anything besides an alphabet (symbols, numbers),
tell the user that they can only input an alphabet. Because the user
might do this by accident, they should get 3 warnings at the beginning
of the game. Each time they enter an invalid input, or a letter they
have already guessed, they should lose a warning. If the user has no
warnings left and enters an invalid input, they should lose a
guess.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Hint #1</strong>: Use calls to the <code>input</code>
function to get the user’s guess.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Check that the user input is an alphabet</li>
<li>If the user does not input an uppercase or lowercase alphabet
letter, subtract one warning or one guess.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Hint #2</strong>: you may find the string functions
<code>str.isalpha(‘your string’)</code> and
<code>str.lower(‘Your String’)</code> helpful! If you don’t know what
these functions are you could try typing <code>help(str.isalpha)</code>
or <code>help(str.lower)</code> in your Spyder shell to see the
documentation for the functions.</p>
<p><strong>Hint #3</strong>: Since the words in words.txt are lowercase,
it might be easier to convert the user input to lowercase at all times
and have your game only handle lowercase.</p>
<p><strong>Example Game Implementation:</strong></p>
<pre><code>You have 3 warnings left.

the parameter name for the <code>hangman</code> function.</li>
<li><code>letters_guessed</code>: The letters that have been guessed so
far. If they guess a letter that is already in
<code>letters_guessed</code>, you should print a message telling them
they’ve already guessed that but do not penalize them for it.</li>
<li><code>guesses_remaining</code>: The number of guesses the user has
left. Note that in our example game, the penalty for choosing an
incorrect vowel is different than the penalty for choosing an incorrect
consonant.</li>
<li><code>warnings_remaining</code>: The number of warnings the user has
left. Note that a user only loses a warning for inputting either a
symbol or a letter that has already been guessed.</li>

Sorry, you ran out of guesses. The word was else.</code></pre>
<p>Once you have completed and tested your code (where you have manually
provided the “secret” word, since knowing it helps you debug your code),
you may want to try running against the computer. If you scroll down to
the bottom of the file we provided, you will see two commented lines
underneath the text</p>
<pre><code>if __name__ == “__main__”:
    #secret_word = choose_word(wordlist)
    #hangman(secret_word)</code></pre>
<p>These lines use functions we have provided (near the top of
hangman.py), which you may want to examine. Try “uncommenting” these
lines, and reloading your code. This will give you a chance to try your
skill against the computer, which uses our functions to load a large set
of words and then pick one at random.</p>
<h2 id="hangman-part-3-the-game-with-hints">Hangman Part 3: The Game
with Hints</h2>
<p>If you have tried playing Hangman against the computer, you may have
noticed that it isn’t always easy to beat the computer, especially when
it selects an esoteric word (like “esoteric”!). It might be nice if you
could ask the computer for a hint, such as a list of all the words that
match what you have currently guessed.</p>
<p>For example, if the hidden word is “tact”, and you have so far
guessed the letter “t”, so that you know the solution is “t_ _ t”, where
you need to guess the two missing letters, it might be nice to know that
the set of matching words (at least based on what the computer initially
loaded) are: tact tart taut teat tent test text that tilt tint toot tort
tout trot tuft twit We are going to have you create a variation of
Hangman (we call this <code>hangman_with_hints</code>, and have provided
an initial scaffold for writing it), with the property that if you guess
the special character * the computer will find all the words from its
loaded list that might match your current guessed word, and print out
each of them. Of course, we don’t recommend trying this at the first
step, since this will print out all 55,900 words that we loaded! But if
you are getting close to an answer and are running out of guesses, this
might help.</p>
<p>To do this, we are going to ask you to first complete two helper
functions:</p>
<h3 id="a-matching-the-current-guessed-word">3.A) Matching the current
guessed word</h3>
<p><code>match_with_gap</code> takes two parameters:
<code>my_word</code> and <code>other_word</code>. <code>my_word</code>
is an instance of a guessed word, in other words, it may have some _ ’s
in places (such as ‘t_ _ t’). <code>other_word</code> is a normal
English word.</p>
<p>This function should return <code>True</code> if the guessed letters
of <code>my_word</code> match the corresponding letters of
<code>other_word</code>. It should return <code>False</code> if the two
words are not of the same length or if a guessed letter in
<code>my_word</code> does not match the corresponding character in
<code>other_word</code>.</p>
<p>Remember that when a letter is guessed, your code reveals all the
positions at which that letter occurs in the secret word. Therefore, the
hidden letter (_ ) <strong>cannot be</strong> done of the letters in the
word that has already been revealed.</p>
<p><strong>Example Usage:</strong></p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; match_with_gaps(&quot;te_ t&quot;, &quot;tact&quot;)
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; match_with_gaps(&quot;a_ _ le&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;)
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; match_with_gaps(&quot;a_ _ le&quot;, &quot;apple&quot;)
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; match_with_gaps(&quot;a_ ple&quot;, &quot;apple&quot;)
False</code></pre>
<p>Hint: You may want to use <code>strip()</code> to get rid of the
spaces in the word to compare lengths.</p>
<h3 id="b-showing-all-possible-matches">3.B) Showing all possible
matches</h3>
<p><code>show_possible_matches</code> takes a single parameter:
<code>my_word</code> which is an instance of a guessed word, in other
words, it may have some _ ’s in places (such as ‘t_ _ t’).</p>
<p>This function should print out all words in <code>wordlist</code>
(notice where we have defined this at the beginning of the file, line
51) that match <code>my_word</code>. It should print “No matches found”
if there are no matches.</p>
<p><strong>Example Usage:</strong></p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; show_possible_matches(&quot;t_ _ t&quot;)
tact tart taut teat tent test text that tilt tint toot tort tout trot tuft
twit
&gt;&gt;&gt; show_possible_matches(&quot;abbbb_ &quot;)
No matches found
&gt;&gt;&gt; show_possible_matches(&quot;a_ pl_ &quot;)
ample amply</code></pre>
<h3 id="c-hangman-with-hints">3.C) Hangman with hints</h3>
<p>Now you should be able to replicate the code you wrote for
<code>hangman</code> as the body of <code>hangman_with_hints</code>,
then make a small addition to allow for the case where the user can
guess an asterisk (*), in which case the computer will print out all the
words that match that guess.</p>
<p>The user should not lose a guess if the guess is an asterisk.</p>
<p>Comment out the lines of code you used to play the original Hangman
game:</p>
<pre><code>    secret_word = choose_word(wordlist)
    hangman(secret_word)</code></pre>
<p>And un­comment out these lines of code we’ve provided at the bottom
